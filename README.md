# Virus_Total_API

The primary goal of this project is to aid in threat intelligence gathering by automatically fetching detailed reports about IP addresses directly from VirusTotal. The script retrieves essential information such as the owner of the IP, its registered country, and a summary of detections categorized as harmless, malicious, suspicious, or undetected by various security vendors. This helps SOC analysts make informed decisions on how to handle traffic to or from specific IP addresses in their network.



1Ô∏è‚É£ First, register for a virus total account and retrive the API key from the homepage.
